# Image Captioning Application

This is an image captioning application that generates captions for input images using the ViT-GPT2 image captioning model. The application includes a backend for model training and inference, as well as a frontend built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

## Model Training

To train the image captioning model, follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Collect or obtain a dataset of images with their corresponding captions. Ensure that the images and captions are properly aligned.

2. **Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset by resizing the images, converting them to a suitable format, and tokenizing the captions.

3. **Model Configuration**: Choose the appropriate model architecture and hyperparameters for the image captioning task. You can refer to the `VisionEncoderDecoderModel` documentation for details on available options.

4. **Training**: Train the model using the preprocessed dataset. This involves feeding the images into the model and optimizing the parameters to minimize the captioning loss.

5. **Model Saving**: Once the training is complete, save the trained model checkpoint and tokenizer. These checkpoints will be used for inference in the application.

## Model Inference

To run the image captioning application and perform inference, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**: Set up the Python environment and install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install the necessary packages mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. **Frontend Configuration**: Modify the Streamlit application code to define the user interface and interaction logic. This includes uploading an image, triggering the caption generation, and displaying the output.

3. **Model Loading**: Load the saved model checkpoint and tokenizer checkpoints using the paths specified in the application code.

4. **Image Captioning**: Preprocess the uploaded image, pass it through the model, and generate captions using the loaded checkpoint and tokenizer.

5. **Running the Application**: Run the Streamlit application using the command `streamlit run app.py` and access it in your web browser.

## Building the Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications. The frontend code resides in `app.py` and includes the following components:

- Image upload functionality to select and display the input image.
- "Generate Caption" button to trigger the caption generation process.
- Output display area to show the generated caption.

To customize the frontend, you can modify the Streamlit application code to include additional features or improve the user interface.

## Conclusion

This image captioning application combines model training, inference, and a Streamlit frontend to provide a user-friendly interface for generating captions for input images. Follow the steps outlined above to train the model, run the application, and customize the frontend according to your requirements.
